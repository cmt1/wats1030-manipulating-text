My favortie text editor is emacs followed by nano. Emacs is easy to use but there is so much to learn, 
I like that you can have two sepreate buffers opened at once. The commands are easy to remember because you 
use the control or alt keys in combination with commands. Nano is my second favorite because it is simple
and easy to use. It feels very straight to the point to accomplish tasks because all the commands are listed
on the bottom of the screen. Vi was my least favorite because I did not like how it has different modes. It makes
you press i to input information and then make sure you exit that mode to save. This week I plan to get a little
more experience with emacs, but for quick work I think nano works best!
