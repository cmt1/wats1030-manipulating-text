The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programming Enviroment(1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system intorduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no
single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to 
programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy cant't be written
down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from
the relationships among programs than from te programs themselves. Many UNIX programs
do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and
useful tools.
